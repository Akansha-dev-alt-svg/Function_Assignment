        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**\n",
        "\n",
        "   OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of “objects” which bundle data and behavior. It helps organize code using classes and promotes reusability and modularity.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **What is a class in OOP**\n",
        "\n",
        "   A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines attributes (variables) and methods (functions) that the objects created from it will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **What is an object in OOP**\n",
        "\n",
        "   An object is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity with its own data and behavior defined by the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Difference between abstraction and encapsulation**\n",
        "\n",
        "   **Abstraction** hides complex implementation details.\n",
        "   **Encapsulation** wraps data and methods into one unit and restricts direct access to internal details.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **What are dunder methods in Python**\n",
        "\n",
        "   Dunder (double underscore) methods like `__init__` or `__str__` are special methods that start and end with double underscores. They enable operator overloading and object behavior customization.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Concept of inheritance in OOP**\n",
        "\n",
        "   Inheritance allows one class (child) to inherit properties and methods from another (parent). It promotes code reuse and a hierarchical class structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **What is polymorphism in OOP**\n",
        "\n",
        "   Polymorphism means “many forms” and allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class while behaving differently depending on their type.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **How is encapsulation achieved in Python**\n",
        "\n",
        "   Encapsulation is achieved by using private/protected attributes and methods (prefixing with `_` or `__`) and controlling access through getters and setters.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. **What is a constructor in Python**\n",
        "\n",
        "   A constructor is a special method (`__init__`) that runs automatically when a new object is created, used to initialize attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. **Class and static methods in Python**\n",
        "\n",
        "    A **class method** uses `@classmethod` and receives the class as the first argument.\n",
        "    A **static method** uses `@staticmethod` and does not take any class or instance reference.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. **What is method overloading in Python**\n",
        "\n",
        "    Python doesn't support true method overloading. Instead, default arguments or `*args` can be used to mimic multiple method behaviors.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. **What is method overriding in OOP**\n",
        "\n",
        "    Method overriding allows a child class to provide a new version of a method defined in the parent class, changing its behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. **What is a property decorator in Python**\n",
        "\n",
        "    The `@property` decorator allows a method to be accessed like an attribute. It’s commonly used to define read-only or computed attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. **Why is polymorphism important in OOP**\n",
        "\n",
        "    It enables flexibility and code reuse. Different classes can define methods with the same name, and the correct one is called at runtime.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. **What is an abstract class in Python**\n",
        "\n",
        "    An abstract class cannot be instantiated directly. It defines a common interface for its subclasses and may contain abstract methods without implementation.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. **Advantages of OOP**\n",
        "\n",
        "    OOP promotes modularity, code reusability, easier maintenance, and the ability to model real-world systems more effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. **Difference between class variable and instance variable**\n",
        "\n",
        "    A class variable is shared across all instances. An instance variable is unique to each object and defined using `self`.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. **What is multiple inheritance in Python**\n",
        "\n",
        "    Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit from more than one parent class, combining their features.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. **Purpose of `__str__` and `__repr__` methods**\n",
        "\n",
        "    `__str__` defines the user-friendly string representation of an object, while `__repr__` gives an official string for debugging or reproduction.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. **Significance of the `super()` function**\n",
        "\n",
        "    `super()` allows access to the parent class’s methods or constructors, especially useful in inheritance to extend functionality.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. **Significance of the `__del__` method**\n",
        "\n",
        "    `__del__` is called when an object is about to be destroyed. It is used for cleanup, like closing files or releasing resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. **Difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod**\n",
        "\n",
        "    `@staticmethod` doesn’t take any reference to class or instance.\n",
        "    `@classmethod` receives the class as the first argument and can access or modify class-level data.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. **How polymorphism works with inheritance**\n",
        "\n",
        "    Subclasses override methods from the parent class. When called, the version that matches the object’s actual type is executed.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. **What is method chaining in Python OOP**\n",
        "\n",
        "    Method chaining is calling multiple methods on the same object in one line by returning `self` at the end of each method.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. **Purpose of the `__call__` method in Python**\n",
        "\n",
        "    `__call__` allows an object to be called like a function. It enables functional behavior in class instances.\n",
